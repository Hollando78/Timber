"1. 
Values in this table are normalised compressive strengths (N/mm²). Compressive strengths of masonry units should be derived according to EN 772-1."
"The table applies to clay and calcium silicate block masonry units where the work size exceeds 337.5mm in length or 112.5mm in height.

Group 1 masonry units have not more than 25% formed voids (20% for frogged bricks). Group 2 masonry units have formed voids greater than"
"25%, but not more than 55%."
